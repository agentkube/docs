Agentkube provides user authentication to track your usage and manage your subscription status. You can access authentication settings through Settings > User.

## Log In Process

To authenticate with your Agentkube account:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **User**
2. Click the **Log In** button
3. You will be redirected to your browser to complete authentication
4. Approve access to allow Agentkube to access your user information and subscription details
5. This enables usage tracking and subscription status monitoring

## Fallback Method

If the localhost redirect fails due to firewall or proxy restrictions:
- The authentication page will display the authorization code on-screen
- Copy and paste the code back into the Agentkube desktop application

## Usage Tracking

Once authenticated, Agentkube can:
- Track your feature usage across different tools and capabilities
- Monitor subscription limits and quotas  
- Display your current subscription status
- Provide usage analytics in the User settings panel
