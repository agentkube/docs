Agentkube collects analytics data to help improve the application and user experience.

## Data Collection

We collect the following analytics data:

- **Feature Usage**: Track which features and tools are being used
- **Application Events**: Monitor application startup and shutdown events
- **Crash Reports**: Collect crash data to identify and fix issues
- **Performance Metrics**: Basic performance and usage statistics

## Settings




### Through GUI

To configure analytics collection:

<Frame caption="General settings with analytics configuration">
  <img src="/images/general.png" alt="General settings interface showing analytics toggle and other configuration options" />
</Frame>

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **General**
2. Locate the analytics toggle option
3. Enable or disable analytics collection based on your preference


### Through Configuration File

You can also manually edit the configuration file at `~/.agentkube/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "general": {
    "usageAnalytics": true
  }
}
```

Set `usageAnalytics` to `true` to enable analytics collection or `false` to disable it.
