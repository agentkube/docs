Agentkube uses subscription-based licensing to provide you with continuous access to our premium features. This document explains how your subscription license works and how to manage it.

## Understanding Your Subscription

Your Agentkube subscription is managed through a license key that remains active as long as your subscription is current.

<Tip>
Each subscription license allows you to activate Agentkube on up to 2 devices simultaneously, perfect for your personal or team setup.
</Tip>

## Subscription Management

### Subscription Status

Your subscription remains active as long as your billing is current. A subscription will only expire if:
- You cancel it and it reaches the end of the current billing cycle
- A payment fails and cannot be processed after multiple retry attempts

<Note>
When your subscription is active, your license key will automatically remain valid without any manual renewal needed.
</Note>

## Device Activation

### Activation Limit

Each subscription license has an activation limit of 2 devices, allowing you to:
- Run Agentkube on two different computers simultaneously
- Share your license between a desktop and laptop

<Warning>
If you attempt to activate on a 3rd device, you'll need to first deactivate one of your existing installations.
</Warning>

### Activating Your License

To activate your subscription on a device:

1. Open Agentkube and navigate to `Settings` > `License`
2. Enter your license key in the provided field
3. Click "Activate License"
4. Upon successful activation, you'll see a confirmation message

### Managing Device Activations

To deactivate your license on a device:

1. Send an email to support@agentkube.com
2. Include your account email and the license key
3. Specify which device you want to deactivate
4. Our support team will process your request

## Security Measures

If your license key is compromised:

1. Email immediately to support@agentkube.com
2. Our team will reset your license key and issue a new one

<Warning>
Resetting your license key will disconnect all instances of Agentkube associated with it. You'll need to activate again using your new key.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues with your license:

- Verify your license key is entered correctly with no extra spaces
- Check that your subscription payment method is up-to-date
- Ensure you haven't exceeded the 2-device activation limit
- Confirm you have an internet connection for verification
