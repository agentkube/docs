1. Investigation Tasks
Agents automatically investigate issues in the background, just like an engineer.
Focused on discovering the root cause of failures by analyzing resource states, cluster activity, dependencies, and alerts.
Connects with external and observability tools - including Prometheus, Alertmanager, Datadog, New Relic, GitHub, Docker, Trivy, and many more - to enrich investigations with broader context.
Surfaces clear, actionable insights that point engineers to the likely cause and next steps, not just raw signals.
2. Recon Mode
Run Agents in read-only access.
Safely explore cluster state without making any changes.
Ideal for audits, compliance checks, and safe troubleshooting.
4. Out-of-the-Box Plugins
Preloaded with essential plugins like OpenCost, Trivy, and Kubernetes Linting.
Instantly extend monitoring, cost visibility, and security scanning without extra setup.
5. Deep Tool Integrations
Agents natively integrate with the tools engineers already rely on:
Security & Scanning: Trivy (image scanning & vulnerabilities)
Cost Monitoring: OpenCost (TBA Cast AI, etc.)
Metrics & Monitoring: Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic, SigNoz
Logging & Tracing: Loki, Tempo, Grafana
CD: ArgoCD
Alerting & Ops: Alertmanager
Runtime & Code: Docker, GitHub
These integrations allow Agents to perform daily tasks and investigations seamlessly.
6. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Marketplace
Built-in MCP Marketplace inside the IDE easy to plug-and-play usage.
No hassle of finding, installing, or configuring MCP servers manually.
7. Context Settings for Agents
Fine-tune how Agents operate in your cluster.
Define rules for:
Which resources to ignore.
Which namespaces to skip.
Custom operational rules Agents must follow.
Ensures safe, governed automation across environments.
8. Workflows with KubeSpotlight
Spotlight-driven workflows directly in the IDE:
Seamlessly jump between clusters.
Describe resources instantly.
Run commands directly.
Navigate between resources via the taskbar itself.
Eliminates constant context-switching for engineers.
9. Custom LLM API Keys
Bring your own keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, AWS Bedrock).
