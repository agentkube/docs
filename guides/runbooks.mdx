Runbookss are a sequence of steps designed to handle Kubernetes operations and gain insights into incidents within the cluster. They can be defined through YAML configuration or managed via the Agentkube dashboard. This documentation explains the structure and components of a Runbooks YAML file.

### Quickstart
Here’s a quick sample of a Runbooks that you can import into your Agentkube dashboard to get started. Use this as a foundation to create your own custom protocol based on your cluster’s needs: [Kubernetes Resource Health Check Protocol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentkube/docs/refs/heads/main/examples/health-check-protocol.yaml)


<Tip>
Runbookss can be created in two ways:

1. **YAML File Import**: Create and import YAML files following the structure defined in this documentation
2. **Agentkube Dashboard**: Use the intuitive web interface in the Agentkube dashboard to create and manage protocols without writing YAML manually
</Tip>

This guide focuses on the YAML file structure for users who prefer to create or manage protocols programmatically.

## File Structure

### Root Level Properties

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  The name of the Runbooks
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="description" type="string" required>
  A detailed description of the protocol's purpose
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="steps" type="array" required>
  An array of step objects defining the protocol workflow
</ResponseField>

### Step Object Properties

Each step in the `steps` array has the following properties:

<ResponseField name="title" type="string" required>
  The title of the step
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="number" type="integer" required>
  The step number (must be unique and sequential)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="details" type="string">
  Detailed description of the step
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="commands" type="array" required>
  Array of command objects to be executed
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="nextSteps" type="array">
  Array of next step objects defining workflow transitions
</ResponseField>

### Command Object Properties

Each command in the `commands` array has the following properties:

<ResponseField name="format" type="string" required>
  The actual command to be executed
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="docString" type="string">
  Documentation describing the command's purpose
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="example" type="string">
  Example usage of the command
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="readOnly" type="boolean">
  If true, command cannot be modified (default: false)
</ResponseField>

### NextStep Object Properties

Each object in the `nextSteps` array has the following properties:

<ResponseField name="referenceType" type="string" required>
  Type of reference: "STEP", "FINAL", or "STOP"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="targetStepNumber" type="integer">
  Required when referenceType is "STEP"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="conditions" type="array">
  Array of condition strings
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="isUnconditional" type="boolean">
  If true, conditions are ignored (default: false)
</ResponseField>

## Reference Types

<Card>
The `referenceType` field can have one of three values:

- `STEP`: Proceed to another step (requires targetStepNumber)
- `FINAL`: End the protocol successfully
- `STOP`: Terminate the protocol
</Card>

## Conditions

<Note>
Conditions are expressions that determine when a next step should be taken. In the Kubernetes example, conditions are written in natural language for clarity:

- "If any pods are in CrashLoopBackOff status, investigate pod logs"
- "If LoadBalancer services show pending external IPs, check cloud provider integration"
- "If all resources are healthy and properly configured"
</Note>

## Example Usage

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Example Protocol
name: Kubernetes Resource Health Check Protocol
description: A comprehensive protocol to check the health and status of Kubernetes resources across namespaces
steps:
  - title: List All Namespaces
    number: 1
    details: Get an overview of all namespaces in the cluster to identify the scope of investigation
    commands:
      - docString: Lists all namespaces in the cluster with their status and age
        example: kubectl get ns --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
        format: kubectl get namespaces
        readOnly: false
    nextSteps: []

  - title: Check Pods Across All Namespaces
    number: 2
    details: Inspect pod status across all namespaces to identify any issues
    commands:
      - docString: Displays all pods across namespaces with their status, restarts, and age
        example: kubectl get pods -A --sort-by='.status.containerStatuses[0].restartCount'
        format: kubectl get pods -A
        readOnly: false
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

### Step Numbers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sequential Numbering">
    Use sequential numbers starting from 1, as shown in the Kubernetes example (1 through 4)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Uniqueness">
    Ensure numbers are unique within the protocol
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Commands

<Steps>
  <Step title="Documentation">
    Use clear, descriptive docStrings that explain the command's purpose
  </Step>
  <Step title="Examples">
    Provide practical examples with useful flags, like sorting and output formatting:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -A --sort-by='.status.containerStatuses[0].restartCount'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Control">
    Use readOnly flag appropriately to control command modification
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Next Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Flow Definition">
    Define clear transitions between steps using conditions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conditions">
    Use clear, actionable conditions that guide the operator
  </Step>
  <Step title="Terminal States">
    Include both FINAL (success) and STOP (critical issues) states
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Workflow Patterns

### Linear Workflow

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Linear Flow
nextSteps:
  - referenceType: STEP
    targetStepNumber: 2
    isUnconditional: true
```
</CodeGroup>

### Conditional Branching

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Conditional Flow
nextSteps:
  - referenceType: STEP
    targetStepNumber: 3
    conditions:
      - If all pods are Running and healthy, proceed to check services
  - referenceType: STOP
    conditions:
      - Critical issues found requiring immediate attention
```
</CodeGroup>

### Terminal Step

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Terminal Step
nextSteps:
  - referenceType: FINAL
    conditions:
      - All resources are healthy and properly configured
    isUnconditional: false
```
</CodeGroup>

## Error Handling

<Card title="YAML Parser Validation">
The YAML parser validates:

- Required fields are present
- Field types are correct
- Step numbers are unique
- Referenced steps exist
- Reference types are valid
</Card>

<Warning>
Common errors to watch for:

1. Missing required fields
2. Invalid reference types
3. Missing target step numbers for STEP references
4. Duplicate step numbers
5. Invalid YAML syntax
</Warning>

## Testing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Syntax Validation">
    Validate YAML syntax
  </Step>
  <Step title="Path Testing">
    Test all possible paths through the workflow:
    - Normal flow (all healthy)
    - Error conditions (pod crashes, service issues)
    - Terminal conditions (both FINAL and STOP)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Command Testing">
    Verify all kubectl commands work as expected
  </Step>
  <Step title="Error Handling">
    Test error scenarios and condition handling
  </Step>
