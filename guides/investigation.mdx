Investigations are automated analysis workflows that help identify and diagnose issues within Kubernetes clusters. They reduce Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) by systematically analyzing cluster state and suggesting remediation steps.

<Tip>
Currently, Investigations can be initiated manually through the Agentkube dashboard. Automatic triggering of response protocol will be added in future releases.

- Determines affected components

### 2. Data Collection
- Collects relevant logs
- Gathers metrics
- Captures cluster state


### 3. Findings
