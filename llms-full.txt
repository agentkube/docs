## Features

### Investigation
Investigation Tasks allow agents to automatically investigate issues in the background, just like an engineer. They focus on discovering the root cause of failures by analyzing resource states, cluster activity, dependencies, and alerts.

Agents analyze resource states, cluster activity, and dependencies to identify the underlying cause of issues. The feature connects with observability tools including Prometheus, Alertmanager, Datadog, New Relic, GitHub, Docker, Trivy, and many more to enrich investigations with broader context.

**How to Use:**
1. Use keyboard shortcut (Command + E on macOS, Ctrl + E on Windows)
2. Pick resource from resource context
3. Select logs from particular container
4. Choose your preferred model
5. Ask the agent to investigate

### Editor
Agentkube Editor is a text editor for working with Kubernetes manifest files.

**Add to Chat Functionality:**
- Select specific lines in Kubernetes resources
- Use Command + K (macOS) or Ctrl + K (Windows) to send context to side chat
- Ask AI assistant questions about manifests and configurations

**Security Tab:**
- Trivy integration for manifest scanning
- Vulnerability detection in container images and configurations
- Detailed reports with severity levels and fixes

**Diff Tab:**
- Change tracking for manifest modifications
- Side-by-side comparison of original and modified versions
- Review changes before applying to cluster

### Recon Mode
Recon Mode provides read-only access to your Kubernetes cluster for both AI agents and human operators, creating a safe environment for exploration, audits, compliance checks, and troubleshooting without the risk of unintended modifications.

**Invoke Recon Mode:**
- Open the Agentkube app and look for the toggle button on the top right
- Use shortcut: Command + / (macOS) or Ctrl + / (Windows/Linux)

### Resource Canvas
Interactive map view of how Kubernetes resources connect with each other. Visualizes dependencies, traffic flows, and bottlenecks to help engineers quickly understand cluster structure and debug issues.

**Access Resource Canvas:**
1. Navigate to Workloads within your cluster
2. Select any workload resource (Deployment, ReplicaSet, etc.)
3. Go into a specific resource (e.g., nginx-deployment)
4. Navigate to the Canvas tab

**How it Works:**
- Deployment view shows ReplicaSet under Deployment and Pods under ReplicaSet
- Interactive navigation by clicking nodes navigates to resource insights page
- Relationship mapping visualizes resource connections and dependencies

### Monitoring
Kubernetes resource monitoring capabilities in Agentkube. Documentation still under process.

### Image Scan
Container image vulnerability scanning using Grype integration for automated security assessment.

## Chat Features

### Side Chat
During cluster management and troubleshooting, you can interact with the AI assistant in the side chat box at any time. This includes answering Kubernetes questions, explaining cluster resources, generating manifests, debugging issues, and more.

**Key Features:**
- Multiple AI models available
- Built-in agents for specialized tasks
- Resource context integration
- Tool integrations (kubectl, helm, monitoring tools)
- Generate and handle Kubernetes resources

### Inline Chat
Agentkube provides inline chat functionality that allows you to quickly add specific context to your chat conversations. This feature is available for both resource editors and log viewers.

**Invoke Inline Chat:**
1. Place cursor in editor or select specific log entries
2. Use shortcut Command + I (macOS) or Ctrl + I (Windows)

**Add to Chat Functionality:**
- Select specific Kubernetes resources in editor
- Click Add to Chat to send resource context to side chat
- Select log entries to send to side chat with timestamps and container context
