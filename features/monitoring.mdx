## Prerequisites

Monitoring in Agentkube currently requires the **kube-prometheus-stack** to be installed in your cluster. This stack provides Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.

<Note>
Support for other observability providers is planned for future releases.
</Note>

## Configuration

To enable monitoring in Agentkube, you need to configure the Prometheus service connection:

### Setting up Prometheus Connection

1. **Open Monitoring Page** - Navigate to the Monitoring section in Agentkube
2. **Access Settings** - Click the settings icon in the top right corner of the monitoring page
3. **Configure Prometheus** - Provide the following required information:
   - **Prometheus Service Address**: The URL endpoint of your Prometheus service
   - **Namespace**: The Kubernetes namespace where Prometheus is deployed

<Note>
Make sure your Prometheus service is accessible from Agentkube and that the service address is correctly formatted (e.g., `prometheus-server:9090`).
