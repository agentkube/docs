This feature is currently in development preview. The design and functionality are not yet finalized and will be updated in future releases.
</Note>

Monitoring in Agentkube provides intuitive visualization and tracking of your Kubernetes cluster metrics, helping you maintain optimal performance and quickly identify potential issues.

<Tip>
Currently, Monitoring is available in the desktop application as a development preview. We're actively experimenting with new approaches to enhance your monitoring experience.
</Tip>

Agentkube's Monitoring feature scrapes metrics from Prometheus, giving you visibility into your cluster's health and performance through an intuitive interface designed to simplify Kubernetes observability.


## Configuring Prometheus Connection

You can configure the Prometheus monitoring service connection by clicking the Settings icon in the top right corner of the Monitoring page. This allows you to set:

- **Namespace**: The Kubernetes namespace where Prometheus is installed (default: "monitoring")
- **Service**: The Prometheus service name and port (default: "prometheus:9090")

These connection details affect where pod metrics are queried from and ensure your monitoring dashboard displays accurate, up-to-date information.


<Note>
We welcome your feedback on the Monitoring preview to help us refine and improve this feature before its official release.
