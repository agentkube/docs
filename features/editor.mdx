## Add to Chat Functionality

Agentkube supports `Add to Chat` functionality rather than full inline editing capabilities. This allows you to:
- Select specific lines in Kubernetes resources in the editor
- Click `Add to Chat` or use the keyboard shortcut (`Command + I` on macOS, `Ctrl + I` on Windows) to send the selected resource context to the side chat
- The selected resource configuration, metadata, and relevant context will be automatically added to your chat conversation
- Ask the AI assistant questions about specific manifests, configurations, or troubleshooting

## Security Tab

Under the **Security** tab, you can scan your manifest files to check for any vulnerabilities:

- **Trivy Integration**: Uses Trivy to scan your Kubernetes manifests
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies security issues in container images, configurations, and resource definitions
- **Detailed Reports**: View vulnerability details, severity levels, and recommended fixes

## Diff Tab

The **Diff** tab allows you to review changes made to your manifest files:

- **Change Tracking**: View all modifications made to your Kubernetes manifests
- **Side-by-side Comparison**: Compare original and modified versions of your files
- **Highlight Changes**: Added, removed, and modified lines are clearly highlighted
- **Review Before Apply**: Review all changes before applying them to your cluster
