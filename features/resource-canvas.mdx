Interactive map view of how Kubernetes resources connect with each other. Visualizes dependencies, traffic flows, and bottlenecks to help engineers quickly understand cluster structure and debug issues.

## Access Resource Canvas

To view the resource canvas:

1. Navigate to **Workloads**, within your cluster
2. Select any workload resource (`Deployment`, `ReplicaSet`, etc.)
3. Go into a specific resource (e.g., `nginx-deployment`)
4. Navigate to the **Canvas** tab

## How it Works

The resource canvas displays relevant upstream and downstream resources related to the current resource:

- **Deployment view**: Shows the ReplicaSet under the Deployment and the Pods under the ReplicaSet
- **Interactive navigation**: Clicking on any node in the resource map navigates directly to that resource's insights page
- **Relationship mapping**: Visualizes how resources connect and depend on each other
