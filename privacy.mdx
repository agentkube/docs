By utilizing the Agentkube Software (defined below) or by otherwise indicating your consent to these Agentkube Terms of Service (the "Terms") you acknowledge and agree to all of the terms and provisions contained herein. Agentkube Technologies, the provider of the Agentkube Platform, is referred to herein as "Agentkube." And you are referred to herein as "Customer." Agentkube and Customer are collectively referred to herein as the "Parties." If you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or any entity other than yourself, you hereby represent and warrant that you have been authorized to do so by such organization or entity. 

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONTAIN AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS. THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE REQUIRES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) THAT YOU SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION, AND FURTHER THAT: (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST COMPANY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, (2) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO SEEK RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND (3) YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US RESOLVED BY A JURY OR IN A COURT OF LAW.

## Information We Collect

### Account & Subscription Data
When you sign up, we collect your name, email address, and authentication credentials.

Subscription and billing details (such as payment method and plan) are handled securely by our payment processor (e.g., Lemon Squeezy). Agentkube does not store full payment details.

### Local Data (Not Collected by Us)
Your Kubernetes cluster configurations, workloads, and logs remain on your local system.

Agentkube does not transmit or store cluster data, kubeconfig files, or workload logs on our servers.

### Usage Analytics (Optional)
With your consent, we may collect anonymous usage metrics (e.g., feature usage, error reports, performance logs) via third-party tools like PostHog.

These analytics help us improve the Software.

You can disable analytics anytime in Settings > General.

### AI Integrations
For AI-powered features, Agentkube connects to OpenRouter and related providers.

Any prompts or requests sent to AI services are processed by those providers under their respective privacy policies.

Agentkube does not log, store, or reuse your AI queries or responses.

## How We Use Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide and maintain the Software
- Verify subscription status and manage access
- Respond to support requests
- Improve the functionality and reliability of the Software
- Where opted in, analyze usage trends to guide product improvements

## How We Share Information

We do not sell or rent your personal information. We only share information as follows:

- **Payment Processors**: To process subscription payments (e.g., Lemon Squeezy)
- **Analytics Providers**: For optional, anonymous usage analytics
- **AI Service Providers**: For AI-powered features, data is transmitted securely to providers such as OpenRouter
- **Legal Requirements**: If required by law, regulation, or valid legal process

## Data Retention

Account and subscription data are retained for as long as your account remains active.

You may request deletion of your account by contacting us at info@agentkube.com.

Local data (cluster configs, workloads, logs) is never collected or retained by Agentkube.

## Security

We implement reasonable security measures (including encryption of sensitive data) to protect account and subscription information.

Since cluster data remains local, you are responsible for securing your own environment, kubeconfig files, and access credentials.

## Your Choices

- **Analytics**: You can enable/disable analytics in the Software settings
- **Account Deletion**: You may request deletion of your account and associated subscription data at any time
- **AI Features**: Use of AI-powered features is optional

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted with a revised "Last Updated" date.
