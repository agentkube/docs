Agents are your intelligent Kubernetes assistants designed to help you manage, debug, and optimize your cluster operations. Agentkube provides AI-powered agents that understand your cluster context and can assist with various Kubernetes management tasks.

## Capabilities of Agents

**Cluster Understanding**: Analyze your Kubernetes cluster resources, configurations, and relationships to provide contextual assistance.

**Resource Management**: Help create, modify, and troubleshoot Kubernetes resources including deployments, services, configmaps, and more.

**Debugging Support**: Assist in identifying and resolving cluster issues, pod failures, networking problems, and performance bottlenecks.

**Best Practices Guidance**: Provide recommendations based on Kubernetes best practices and your specific cluster configuration.

**Tool Integration**: Utilize built-in and extended tools to interact with your cluster, monitoring systems, and external services.

**Multi-Cluster Support**: Work across different cluster contexts while maintaining awareness of cluster-specific configurations and rules.

## How Agents Work

Agents in Agentkube operate within the context of your selected Kubernetes cluster and follow these principles:

**Context Awareness**: Agents understand your current cluster context, namespace, and available resources.

**Rule-Based Behavior**: Follow user-defined rules and cluster-specific guidelines to provide consistent and appropriate assistance.

**Resource Filtering**: Respect `.kubeignore` configurations to focus on relevant resources while maintaining security.

**Tool Utilization**: Leverage built-in tools (kubectl, helm, filesystem, terminal) and configured extended tools for comprehensive cluster management.

**Secure Operations**: Operate within the permissions and constraints defined by your cluster access and configuration settings.
